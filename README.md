This project is a "Portfolio Project" for Codecademy's Computer Science Carreer Path for CS102: Data Structures and Algorithms

The project overview from Codecademy (https://www.codecademy.com/paths/computer-science/tracks/cspath-cs-102/modules/data-structures-and-algorithms-portfolio-project/kanban_projects/recommendation-software-project):

Welcome to the portfolio project in CS 102: Data Structures and Algorithms!

In this portfolio project, you will research, brainstorm, and build a basic recommendation program for a topic of your choice. By entering letters or words into the terminal, the program will suggest a specific category for the user to explore. If the user is interested in the category, the program will provide a variety of related recommendations to the user. After you finish building the program, you will create a blog post to share the program on a publication of your choice!


Project Objectives:
Store data in a data structure
Use an algorithm to sort or search for data within a data structure
Use Git version control
Use the command line and file navigation
Write a technical blog post on the project

My Project
I chose to make a rental car recommendation.

The cars and car types are stored in lists (see cars.py).

I used a linked list data structure to hold the data and for searching per user input (see linkedlist.py).

I created some functions to insert the data into the linked lists and then also to traverse through them and filter for what the user had input (see rentalcar.py).

The actual application is contained in script.py. This contains the actual creation of the linked lists and the control-flow per user input.
